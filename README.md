# Project Overview üîé
Prompted by the university class of Numerical Analysis, in this project stock predictions for two Greek companies had to be conducted.
[Here]([https://github.com/theosavv/Numerical-Analysis/blob/main/Numerical-Analysis/First_Mandatory_Assignment_Numerical_Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/theosavv/Stock-Prediction/blob/main/Numerical%20Methods%20and%20Stock%20Prediction/Second_Mandatory_Assignment_Numerical_Analysis%20(1).pdf)) the extensive presentation of the project can be found.
# What I learned üí°
This assignment was a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in practice and understand how predictions can be made in real world examples using foundamental concepts of Linear Algebra and programming.
# Technical info ‚öôÔ∏è
All of the methods are implemented in MATLAB. There is also a `main` method that includes LateX source code.
